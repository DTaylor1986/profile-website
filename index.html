            <h4>Summary of pharmaceutical experience</h4>
            <p>I currently work for a pharmaceutical company as a QA specialist within the laboratory. Within this role I am responsible for the approval of quality investigations such as deviations and out of specifications, as well as change controls, ensuring that adequate CAPA is being implemented. My other primary functions include the approval of SOP’s and work instructions through the quality management system, in addition to operational documents for the laboratory such as protocols and reports, which would extend to method validation, stability and microbiology. Other operational documents include, testing specifications, certificates of analysis and analytical methods. </p>
            <p>Typical tasks of my current role also include participation within self-inspections, supplier audits and preparation for internal audits. To complete these functions, I am required to continuously ensure that my knowledge of ICH, GMP, EMA and FDA guidance is up to date.</p>
            <p>A large part of my role is coordinating between area’s of the business to maintain overall quality standards, including reviewing and discussing to PSF/DPFs, technical agreements. I’ll also support other QA teams within the business where required, providing oversight to production and logistics departments, particularly when cross-functional support of OOS investigations is required. </p>
            <p>As the Lead Stability Coordinator I was responsible for a team of three, where we managed all stability activities that extend beyond analysis. This included the set up and closedown of studies, liaising with external laboratories and compiling stability assessments. This role was client facing and required that I maintain contact with clients and provide advice where necessary. This team was also responsible for assisting the quality departments with the compilation of product quality reviews, ensuring that the schedule was adhered to and all appropriate quality information included. </p>
            <p>During my time within the stability group I was responsible for creating a stability specific training program, giving insight into the ICH requirements for stability and education on appropriate trending method. This would then be incorporated into the training program for the department, in which I had also rolled out. </p>
            <p>Prior to 2017 I had participated in continuous improvement projects such as 5S and lean six sigma activities, these improvements then encouraged use of KPI's throughout the company with a keen interest in recording safety, quality, delivery and cost. My experience within the laboratory had also resulted in me undertaking the scheduling for a team of analysts and extending this into the creation of project plans for each product scheduled.</p>
